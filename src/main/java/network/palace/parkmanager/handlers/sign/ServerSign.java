/**
 * <p>The {@code ServerSign} class manages sign-based functionality within the system, allowing
 * for the registration of custom signs with specific handlers and interaction logic.
 * This functionality can be used for creating interactive signs that respond to player actions
 * in a predefined way.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key features of the {@code ServerSign} class include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Registration of signs via the {@code registerSign} method, associating a sign header with a {@code SignHandler}.</li>
 *   <li>Efficient retrieval of sign entries through the {@code getByHeader} method, which uses the sign header as a key.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage involves defining custom {@code SignHandler}s for specific behaviors, such as reacting to sign changes,
 * player interaction, or sign destruction. This allows for dynamic extensibility and custom responses to player engagement.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code ServerSign} class consists of two nested static classes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SignEntry} - Represents the registration entry for a sign, including its header and the associated handler.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SignHandler} - An abstract base class that defines the logic for various sign-related events.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Nested Classes Overview:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *      <strong>{@code SignEntry}:</strong>
 *      <p>Encapsulates the data of a registered sign and its associated behavior handler.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>{@code header} - The identifying string for the sign.</li>
 *         <li>{@code handler} - The {@code SignHandler} responsible for handling actions on the sign.</li>
 *      </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *      <strong>{@code SignHandler}:</strong>
 *      <p>An abstract base class that provides the framework for handling sign-related events,
 *      such as sign placement, interaction, and removal. Subclasses should override the provided
 *      methods to define custom behavior.</p>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>{@code onSignChange} - Triggered when a sign is placed or modified.</li>
 *         <li>{@code onInteract} - Triggered when a player interacts with the sign.</li>
 *         <li>{@code onBreak} - Triggered when a sign is broken.</li>
 *      </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Methods Summary:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *      <strong>{@code registerSign(String header, SignHandler handler)}:</strong>
 *      <p>Allows the registration of a new sign entry by specifying the sign header and
 *      its associated {@code SignHandler}. This ensures that the system can recognize the sign
 *      and apply the desired behavior during interactions.</p>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *      <strong>{@code getByHeader(String s)}:</strong>
 *      <p>Retrieves a {@code SignEntry} based on the provided header. The search is case-insensitive
 *      and ignores any color formatting in the header string.</p>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
