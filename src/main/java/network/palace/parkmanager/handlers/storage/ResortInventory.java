/**
 * Represents the inventory system for a specific resort, encompassing various storage elements such as backpacks, lockers, bases, and builds.
 *
 * <p>Each instance of {@code ResortInventory} contains the following inventory types:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Backpack:</b> Represents a personal storage element for items.</li>
 *   <li><b>Locker:</b> Represents a secure, larger storage space for additional items.</li>
 *   <li><b>Base:</b> Represents a storage area for foundational or shared items.</li>
 *   <li><b>Build:</b> Represents a storage area for crafted or constructed items.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class includes methods to manage the data and utilities for converting the inventory data
 * (stored in various JSON and hash formats) to direct {@code StorageData}, a more usable object for interaction.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Key Features:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Stores JSON representations for each type of inventory, along with their hash values for validation purposes.</li>
 *   <li>Supports size configurations for the {@code backpack} and {@code locker} inventories.</li>
 *   <li>Allows for conversion of inventory data into an interactive {@code StorageData} object for game-related operations.</li>
 *   <li>Provides a utility to determine if all current inventory JSON data is empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Core Methods:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link #isEmpty()}</b>: Checks whether all inventory JSON data is empty, indicating no stored data.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link #toStorageData()}</b>: Converts the current inventory data into a usable {@code StorageData} object,
 *   filling it with parsed {@code ItemStack}s and applying necessary filters.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class uses multiple utility methods and dependencies for JSON parsing, inventory creation, and storage filtering.</p>
